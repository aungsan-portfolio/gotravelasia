  **Design Movement**: **Modern Swiss / International Typographic Style**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Objective Clarity**: Information is presented with absolute precision and minimal ornamentation. The focus is on the data (prices, dates, locations).
  2.  **Grid Systems**: A strict, mathematical grid underpins every layout, ensuring alignment and order.
  3.  **Asymmetry**: Dynamic, asymmetrical compositions create visual interest and guide the eye without relying on centering.
  4.  **Photography as Content**: Large, high-quality images are treated as primary content, not just decoration. They are often cropped boldly or used full-bleed.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Primary**: **International Orange (#FF4F00)** - High visibility, energetic, associated with urgency and movement (like airport signage).
  *   **Secondary**: **Slate Grey (#2D3748)** and **Crisp White (#FFFFFF)** - Provides a neutral, high-contrast background for the primary color and photography.
  *   **Accent**: **Electric Blue (#007AFF)** - Used sparingly for interactive elements and trust indicators.
  *   **Intent**: To convey efficiency, reliability, and a modern, global perspective. It feels like a high-end travel magazine meets a powerful booking tool.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Modular / Card-Based**: Content is organized into distinct modules or cards that snap to the grid.
  *   **Split Screens**: Vertical split screens are used to juxtapose imagery with information (e.g., half the screen is a photo of Bali, the other half is the booking form).
  *   **Whitespace**: Generous, active whitespace is used to separate sections and focus attention.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Bold Typography**: Large, sans-serif headlines (Helvetica Now or similar) that anchor the page.
  2.  **Geometric Icons**: Simple, stroke-based icons that match the typographic weight.
  3.  **Micro-Interactions**: Subtle hover effects that lift cards or shift buttons, providing immediate feedback without clutter.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Direct & Efficient**: Interactions are snappy and responsive. No unnecessary delays or complex animations.
  *   **Contextual**: Tools and information appear when needed, keeping the interface clean.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Slide & Reveal**: Elements slide into place from the grid lines.
  *   **Parallax**: Subtle parallax effects on background images to add depth.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headlines**: **Inter** (Bold, Tight Tracking) - For maximum impact and readability.
  *   **Body**: **Inter** (Regular, Normal Tracking) - For clear, legible text.
  *   **Monospace**: **JetBrains Mono** - Used for data points like flight numbers or prices, adding a technical touch.

  **Design Movement**: **Organic Modernism / "Japandi"**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Nature-Inspired**: The design mimics the forms and colors of the natural world (earth, sea, sky).
  2.  **Softness & Warmth**: Rounded corners, soft shadows, and warm tones create a welcoming and relaxing atmosphere.
  3.  **Simplicity**: Clutter is eliminated. Only the essential elements remain, allowing the user to focus on the dream of travel.
  4.  **Tactility**: Textures and subtle patterns give the interface a physical, almost paper-like quality.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Primary**: **Sage Green (#8FBC8F)** - Calming, natural, and associated with growth and renewal.
  *   **Secondary**: **Sand / Beige (#F5F5DC)** - A warm, neutral background that feels organic.
  *   **Accent**: **Terracotta (#E2725B)** - A warm, earthy accent for CTAs and highlights.
  *   **Intent**: To evoke the feeling of a relaxing vacation before the trip even begins. It feels like a boutique hotel or a wellness retreat.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Fluid / Organic**: Layouts are less rigid, with elements flowing into one another.
  *   **Overlapping Elements**: Images and text blocks overlap slightly to create depth and connection.
  *   **Central Focus**: Key elements are often centered or framed by negative space to draw the eye gently.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Rounded Shapes**: Buttons, cards, and images have generous border radii.
  2.  **Organic Shapes**: Blobs or waves are used as background elements to break up straight lines.
  3.  **Serif Typography**: An elegant serif font is used for headlines to add sophistication and warmth.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Gentle & Smooth**: Transitions are slow and ease-in/out.
  *   **Immersive**: Hover effects are subtle, perhaps a slight scale or color shift.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Fade & Float**: Elements fade in and float gently into position.
  *   **Morphing**: Shapes morph and change as the user scrolls.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headlines**: **Playfair Display** (Italic/Regular) - For an editorial, elegant look.
  *   **Body**: **Lato** (Light/Regular) - A humanist sans-serif that complements the serif headlines.

  **Design Movement**: **Cyber-Brutalism / Neo-Brutalism**
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Raw & Unpolished**: The design embraces the "default" look of the web but stylizes it. Borders are thick, shadows are hard, and colors are high-contrast.
  2.  **Honesty**: No gradients or drop shadows to hide the digital nature of the interface.
  3.  **Boldness**: High-contrast colors and large typography demand attention.
  4.  **Function Over Form**: The aesthetic is driven by the utility of the elements.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Primary**: **Acid Green (#CCFF00)** or **Neon Pink (#FF00CC)** - Extremely high visibility and energy.
  *   **Secondary**: **Black (#000000)** and **White (#FFFFFF)** - Stark contrast.
  *   **Accent**: **Blue (#0000FF)** - Standard hyperlink blue, used ironically or for emphasis.
  *   **Intent**: To appeal to a younger, digital-native audience who values authenticity and directness. It feels like a zine or a raw data feed.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Grid-Visible**: The grid lines are often visible, separating content into clear boxes.
  *   **Dense**: Information is packed tightly, maximizing screen real estate.
  *   **Asymmetric**: Elements are placed unpredictably to create tension.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Thick Borders**: All elements have thick, black borders.
  2.  **Hard Shadows**: Shadows are solid black and offset, creating a sticker-like effect.
  3.  **System Fonts**: Use of default system fonts or monospaced fonts to emphasize the "raw" aesthetic.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Immediate**: No transition times. Hover states are instant color swaps.
  *   **Tactile**: Buttons feel like physical switches.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Marquee**: Scrolling text for announcements or deals.
  *   **Glitch**: Occasional glitch effects on hover or load.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headlines**: **Archivo Black** or **Space Mono** (Bold) - Heavy, industrial.
  *   **Body**: **Space Mono** or **Courier New** - Technical, raw.
